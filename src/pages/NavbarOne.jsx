              BIOGRAPHY
            </p>
            <p>
              Before we can answer this question we need to define passion.
              Passion, as this executive exemplifies, is energy and engagement
              for people and the work they do. Passion as an emotion is a
              valuable trait when channeled appropriately. Focused on helping
              others understand and doing good work is positive passion. Losing
              your cool when things go wrong is negative passion. The challenge
              is to channel the positive to ameliorate or eliminate the
              negative.
            </p>
            <p>
              Passion becomes the catalyst that galvanizes individuals to commit
              to their own development as well as to deliver products and
              services that customers need. Passion too develops when employees
              commit – on company time – to give back to their community as
              volunteers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Passion is a powerful driver when applied to purpose. It becomes
              the personal commitment to making a positive difference to achieve
              sustainable results.
